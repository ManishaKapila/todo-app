We all have those days when there are a million things to do, and we don't know how we're going to get it all done. 
It's easy to become overwhelmed by the vast quantity of tasks that we must do from day to day. 

Sometimes we have so many balls in the air, that we may even lose track of some loose ends and forget to do important things. 
When we get too busy, we end up feeling like we are barely able to keep our heads above water.

To-Do is a new, intelligent task management app that makes it easy to plan and manage your day. 

- To-Do helps you create a list for anythingâ€”for work, home projects or just your groceries. 
- You can keep track of deadlines by adding reminders, due dates and notes, and personalize each list with colorful themes. 
- Plan your day with intelligent Suggestions
- Managing your to-dos and lists can sometimes take as much effort as completing them. 
- To-Do helps you focus and plan your day from the moment you open the app. Every morning, your My Day list starts out with a clean slate, allowing you to be more intentional about what you want to get done.
